===Ahn's withdrawal from the campaign, endorsing Yoon Suk-yeol===
On 20 February 2022, Ahn clarified that there won't be further negotiations over unification with Yoon Suk-yeol, a week after he proposed a unified opposition campaign through opinion polls that ask who will be more suitable for the presidency and to defeat Lee Jae-myung, the nominee of the governing [[Democratic Party of Korea|Democratic Party]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220225000600|title=Ahn says merger talks have failed while Yoon insists he is working on it|date=25 February 2022|work=[[The Korea Herald]]}}</ref>

However, on the night of 2 March 2022, hours after the last presidential debate, Ahn met Yoon at the house of the brother-in-law of [[Chang Je-won]], assemblymember for the People Power Party, and a close aide to Yoon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsdirectory3.com/late-night-meeting-between-yoon-seok-yeol-and-ahn-cheol-soo-tentative-agreement-on-unification-of-the-opposition-parties/|title=Late-night meeting between Yoon Seok-yeol and Ahn Cheol-soo… Tentative agreement on unification of the opposition parties|work=News Directory 3|date=2 March 2022}}</ref> On the morning of 3 March, Ahn and Yoon made a joint statement that the two candidates decided to join forces to change the government.

The unification seemed to be over by most of the commentators, as ballot papers including Ahn's name were already printed. In addition, [[absentee ballot]]s of overseas residents have already been cast between 23 and 28 February. Those voting on the day of the election will still see Ahn's name on the ballot, even though ballots cast for Ahn will be counted invalid. After the joint statement, the members' board of the People Party went down due to an overflow of complaints of the members of the party.{{cn needed|date=March 2022}}

Ahn also faced criticisms over breaking his promise of achieving [[Third Way]] politics and implementing [[multi-party system]] in South Korean politics. Just days before the unification, he said "if you vote for Yoon, you'll want to cut your finger after a year".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chosun.com/politics/election2022/2022/02/28/SVZMYHQUEZHWNMRXQJDIIJY2OQ/|title=안철수 "尹 뽑으면 1년 후 손 자르고 싶을 것" 정청래 "명연설"|website=조선일보|date=28 February 2022}}</ref>

Ahn also secured his public image as "withdrawal", which is the Korean word that sounds the same as Ahn's given name, Cheol-soo. This is the fourth election in which Ahn withdrew his candidacy. Ahn withdrew in [[2011 Seoul mayoral by-election|2011]] and [[2021 South Korean by-elections#Mayor of Seoul|2021]] to [[Park Won-soon]] and [[Oh Se-hoon]] respectively for the mayoralty of [[Seoul]], and in [[2012 South Korean presidential election|2012]] and 2022 to Moon Jae-in and Yoon Suk-yeol respectively for the presidency.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220303000732|title=Opposition merger adds to Ahn's career of withdrawal|date=3 March 2022|work=[[The Korea Herald]]}}</ref>
